This is a shield for Arduino Micro that facilitates the connection of a digital LED strip and the control of animations with buttons.

You can buy [a bare PCB](http://my.agile-hardware.de/de/ws28xx-micro-adapter-nur-pcb), [a kit including an Arduino micro](http://my.agile-hardware.de/de/ws28xx-micro-adapter-kit) and a [compatible LED Strip](http://my.agile-hardware.de/de/search?page=search&page_action=query&desc=on&sdesc=on&keywords=ws8xx) from us.

This sketch requires the [FastLED Library](http://fastled.io) to be installed. All necessary user settings can be found in the 'settings.h' file.

Detailed instructions on how to build the kit and write your own animations can be found [in german on your blog](http://www.agile-hardware.de/digitale-leds-steuern/).
